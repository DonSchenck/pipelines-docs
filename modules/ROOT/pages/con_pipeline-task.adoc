= Task

A `Task` (or a `ClusterTask`) is a collection of sequential steps that run as part of a continuous integration flow. A `Task` runs in the pod on your cluster.

A `Task` declares:

* Inputs
* Outputs
* Steps

A `Task` is available in a namespace and a `ClusterTask` is available across the cluster. The sequential execution of `Tasks` defines a `Pipeline`. Creating a `Pipeline` is defining the order of the `Tasks` that you want to run.
