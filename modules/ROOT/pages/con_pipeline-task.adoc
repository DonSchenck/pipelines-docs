= Task

A `Task` (or a `ClusterTask`) is a collection of sequential steps that run as part of a continuous integration flow. A `Task` runs in the pod on your cluster.

A `Task` declares:

* Inputs
* Outputs
* Steps

A `Task` is available in a namespace and a `ClusterTask` is available across the cluster.
