= Tasks


A `Task` or a `ClusterTask` is a collection of sequential steps you would want to run as part of your continuous integration flow. A task will run inside a pod on your cluster.

A `Task` declares:

* I*puts
* Outputs
* Steps

A `Task` is available within a namespace, and `ClusterTask` is available across
the cluster.
