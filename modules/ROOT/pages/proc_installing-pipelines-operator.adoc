. On the *Create Operator Subscription* screen, ensure the installation mode selected is *All namespaces on the cluster (default)*, then click *Subscribe*.

NOTE: The operator is installed automatically into the `openshift-operators` namespace. The option to install in *A specific namespace on the cluster* should be disabled.  The OpenShift Pipelines operator should watch for Tekton Custom Resources across all namespaces.

. In the *Subscription Overview* screen, verify the installation of the operator by confirming that the *UPGRADE STATUS* is `1 installed`.
