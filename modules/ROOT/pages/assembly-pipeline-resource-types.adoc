`PipelinesResources` in a pipeline are the set of objects that are going to be
used as inputs to a `Task` and can be output by a `Task`.

A `Task` can have multiple inputs and outputs.

To define a configuration file for a `PipelineResource`, you must specify the
following fields:

*   Required:
    **  `apiVersion`- Specifies the API version
    **   `kind` - Specify the `PipelineResource` resource object.
    **   `metadata` - Specifies data to uniquely identifythe `PipelineResource`      object, for example a `name`.
    **   `spec`- Specifies the configuration information
        for your `PipelineResource` resource object.
    **   `type` - Specifies the `type` of the `PipelineResource`
*   _Optional_:
    **   `params` - Parameters which are specific to each type
        of `PipelineResource`

The following `PipelineResources` types are currently supported:

*   Git Resource
*   Pull Request Resource
*   Image Resource
*   Cluster Resource
