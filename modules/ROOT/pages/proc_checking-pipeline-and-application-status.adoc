= Checking pipeline and application status

You can examine the logs for `PipelineRuns` to verify its status.

[discrete]
=== Procedure

. Check the `PipelineRun` logs as it runs using the `tkn pipeline logs` command, which interactively allows you to chose the required pipelinerun and inspect the logs:
+
----
$ tkn pipeline logs -f
? Select pipeline : build-and-deploy
? Select pipelinerun : build-and-deploy-run-tsv92 started 39 seconds ago
----

. To rerun the last pipelinerun, using the same pipeline resources and service account used in the previous pipeline, use:
+
----
tkn pipeline start build-and-deploy --last
----
. To verify the application deployment in  the OpenShift web console, switch to the *Developer* perspective.

. In the *Topology* view, select the *pipelines-tutorial* project from the *Project* drop-down menu to see the successfully built and deployed applications.
