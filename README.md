# Openshift Pipelines Documentation

Welcome to the source file repository for OpenShift Pipelines documentation.

OpenShift Pipelines is a cloud-native CI/CD solution built for Kubernetes and is based on the upstream Tekton project (previously known as Knative Build).
It complements the Jenkins images that are shipped with OpenShift (OCP).

The operator for OpenShift Pipelines is available in the OpenShift OperatorHub.
To try out OpenShift Pipelines, obtain an OCP cluster by visiting [cloud.redhat.com](https://cloud.redhat.com) or [rhpds.redhat.com](https://rhpds.redhat.com).
